# FYP_Project
My undergraduate project

## Description
1. This version of the code would not be able to input polygon that is not triangle anymore

## Version Selection
### V4-release
1. tried the incenter to improve the accuracy
2. analysis and compare the function for all extra points

### V4.3
1. use the middle point (centroid) to improve accuracy
2. tried the circumcenter to improve accuracy 
3. tried the orthocenter to improce the accuracy

### V4.2
1. use middle point to improve accuracy (connect middle point with correspond nodes)

### V4.1
1. use middle point to improve accuracy (connected all the middle point in a triangle) => not improve the accuracy


## Third Party Softwares for this project

### Triangle
1. used to get the delaunary triangulation


### veeMeshViewer
1. Used to view the poly format image
2. only for windows platform
